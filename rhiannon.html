    <h1 id="Rhiannon"><p style="color: darkslategrey;"><span title="I Remember Rhiannon. I remember seeing the focus plastered on their faces, as their eyes shift and eyebrows raise. I remember Come as You Are playing on the hand held radio. We were eight and ten. I remember not having the best clothes at school or not having glitter-covered kicks. Not the newest Barbie diary or the coolest new game. But I had a radio and my family's broken iPod Nano. That was enough. I remember Rhiannon. I remember Stevie, Lindsay, Mick, Christine and John. They were my friends that sat with me in the garden. There were honey bees that wove their way through the flowers, and rested on my toes. Their buzzing and swaying of the violets in the mist. It was easier. Everything seemed so small. I remember how when it was too hot inside we would lay in the grass and roll cold water bottles down our faces. We would laugh as our clothes stuck to our skin from the sweat and the water from our noses would drip down our necks. I remember waiting for our dad to pull into the driveway every night. I remember how mom would watch from the window and disappear.I remember the nights when something went wrong. We would sit at the top of the stairs and listen for the glass and slaps. I remember the crying pushing through the walls. I remember going to the JCC that summer. Sitting with the radio in the bushes, watching boys in their shorts and the girls squeezed in their suits would run by. I was scared that someone would catch me staring. I remember Rhiannon. From the first day of fifth grade. Math, second row. I remember how her bright red converse matched her red hair. I remember the butterflies I had in my stomach as she brushed her hand against mine as she reached for her pencil. I remember how she would help me put my back brace on after gym in the seventh grade, and how she would shake the wrinkles out of my shirts before I would put them on. The day she moved away she put a gold star sticker on my radio, she told me that I needed more sparkles. Holding my radio on my walks I rubbed away the gold and glitter on the star. Now it's just a faded outline. I remember Rhiannon. I remember when I felt faded. When I realized how my dark thoughts could quickly turn into actions. I remember sitting in my room on a Tuesday night my freshman year, stuffing clothes into my backpack. Hearing shouts from my mother when she found my bottle of detergent and the note in my jacket pocket. To get out of the house. I put on my red converse and left. I remember Rhiannon. I remember pulling my radio out of my jacket pocket. I thought everything would fly away with the moving cars as I walked the bridge above the highway. I remember laying in the grass with my honey bees. I remember the breeze moving the voices of the radio through the air. I remember her red hair and red shoes.I remember the darkness but also the light. I remember Rhiannon. ">rhiannon</span></a></p></h1>
