I cannot be great when the expectation is mediocre. The structure was in the wrong time. I did not need it then. But it's the only thing I need now. I cannot give it myself. So I must settle for something less. Unless I gave it all up now. Eight seconds left. To decide what it'll take. Let the devil in my mind take every ounce of my self control. This drug is roping me together.">cherry bombs are 8 balls</span></a></p></h1>
